#### MUST BE DONE BEFORE SUBMISSION:

Finish filling out the About page. Should be 3-4 pages if typed.
	What was our motivation?
		What questions were we trying to answer?
			How effective are the museum's different forms of outreach?
			How are children of different ages responding to the exhibit?
			How did daily weather conditions affect responses to the exhibit?
	What was our design process?
		How many records?
		How many columns are we using?
		Data cleaning.
		Sent mockup to client for evaluation.
	Justify the design.
		Had to harmonize data across multiple survey instruments.
		Timeline lines are not colorblind safe, but they are clear to people who are NOT colorblind. And the shapes help people who are.
		Design is too tall to see in one page, but otherwise it would be too small to be legible.
	What were our findings?
		What were the answers to our questions?
	Reflections
		What did we learn?
		What limitations did we encounter?

A 2-4 minutes YouTube video showing the use of your visualization with narration.

Add a brief intro at the top of the page, with a link to the YouTube video.

Upload the application to a web host.

Clean up this README file and make sure the description above is appropriate for public viewing.


#### WANT DONE BEFORE SUBMISSION:

Get all vis working with filter buttons.

Can I cycle through the Outside Longer Than values?

Can we make the filter buttons more consistent, so they all have the same default setting?


#### TODO SOMEDAY:
Consider a column to the far right of the timeline with overall stats for the time period.

Create column highlight hoverbars.

				This data visualization was created by Carl Klutzke, Sarah Nikkhah, and Hawra Rabaan as our final project for H517: "Visualization Design, Analysis, & Evaluation" at IUPUI in Fall 2018, taught by Dr. Khairi Reda. The purpose of the assignment was [TODO:]
			</p>
			<p>
				To complete this assignment, we had to overcome the following challenges:
				<ul>
					<li>We had [TODO: how long?] to complete the project.</li>
					<li>This was our second project with the D3 library.</li>
					<li>TODO: What else?</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				The source for this project is available on GitHub as TODO.

				I developed the visualization iteratively. I started by rendering the map, the pumps, and the death locations as the minimum viable product. The instructor provided a detailed rubric for how the project would be graded, and I added the graph and other features one by one according to those requirements and as my time and expertise allowed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I estimated the placement of the street and building labels by temporarily 	adding an onclick event to the map. This logged the location of each click for a starting estimate of the label placement. Afterward I commented out the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				The X scale of the graph was initially separate from an X rangeband scale that I used to draw the gray hoverbars. However, I couldn't get the bars to center over the drawn datapoints, probably due to rounding. I finally figured out how to use the same X scale to place the hoverbars, which makes much more sense than trying to keep parallel scales in synch.
			</p>
			<p>
				I asked two subjects to provide user testing for the visualization. I simply presented them with the web page and ask them to interact with it. The resulting observations helped me improve the display and clarify the accompanying text.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the user test observations was that it is difficult to tell the different shades of green on the By Age graph apart. I experimented with different color schemes, but none of the alternatives seemed to be more clear. Categorical color sets of six colors were not colorblind-safe, and didn't convey a sense of increasing age. Diverging colorsets used pale colors in the mid-range, which weren't visible against the white background. In the end I decided that my initial green shading was as adequate a solution as I was likely to find.
